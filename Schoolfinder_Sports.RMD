## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
##Load tidyverse**

library(tidyverse)
?pivot_longer
##Load csv and create a dataframe

Sports <- read.csv('2023-1221_SchoolFinder_CER_Sports.csv', stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE)
Sports$campus_number <- as.character(Sports$campus_number)

## Subset of data file

Baseball <- Sports[, c("campus_number", "baseball")]

class(Baseball$baseball)
####

Baseball <- Baseball %>%
  mutate(baseball = str_replace_all(baseball, c("1" = "club-sports_baseball-boys", "2" = "uil-sports_baseball-boys", "3" = "club-sports_baseball-girls", "4" = "uil-sports_baseball-girls", "5" = "club-sports_baseball-coed", "6" = "uil-sports_baseball-coed", "-99" = "NA")))
  

Baseball_final <- Baseball %>% mutate(ind = Baseball$campus_number) %>%
  separate_rows(baseball, sep=",") 


### rename column 1 to "entitiy_id"

names(Baseball_final)[1] <- "entity_id"


Baseball_final[c('type', 'value')] <- str_split_fixed(Baseball_final$baseball, '_', 2)

### remove zeros from 'value' and NA from 'type'

Baseball_final <-filter(Baseball_final, type!='NA')
  

### remove unneeded columns

Baseball_final$baseball <- NULL

Baseball_final$ind <- NULL


### export dataframe to excel

### write(Baseball_final, "baseball.csv", row.names = FALSE)
