## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
##Load tidyverse**

library(tidyverse)

##Load csv and create a dataframe

Sports <- read.csv('2023-1221_SchoolFinder_CER_Sports.csv')

## Subset of data file

Baseball <- Sports[, c("campus_number", "baseball")]

## convert "-99" to "0"

Baseball["baseball"][Baseball["baseball"] == "-99"] <- "0"
print(Baseball)



##Identify the data types or 'class'

sapply(Baseball, class)

Baseball %>%
  separate(Baseball,
           col = baseball,
           into = c("1", "2", "3", "4","5", "6", NA),
           sep =",")


### Sports$campus_number <- as.character(Sports$campus_number)

##Sports %>%
  ##pivot_longer(cols = c('campus_number', 'baseball'),
               ##names_to = 'entity_id',
               ##values_to = 'value')
